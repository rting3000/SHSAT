# 12-Week SHSAT Study Guide for 7th Graders

This guide provides a 12-week daily study plan to help a 7th grader prepare for the New York City Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT). The plan is broken down into three major milestones to track progress and utilizes the official materials provided in the `Docs` folder.

## Simple Tech Stack & Core Materials

This study guide relies on simple, free, and easily accessible online tools.

*   **Core Materials (in `Docs` folder):**
    *   `2024+SHSAT+Exam.pdf`: The primary practice test for our plan.
    *   `2024-2025-nyc-specialized-high-schools-student-handbook.pdf`: For understanding test rules and logistics.
    *   `nyc-guide-to-the-shsat-for-2024-admissions.pdf`: Contains Practice Test A and B, which we will use for milestones.
    *   Older guides (`2022`, `2023`) for additional practice problems.
*   **Google Drive/Docs:** To store and review your "mistake log" and notes.
*   **Google Calendar:** To schedule daily study sessions.
*   **Khan Academy:** For video lessons and practice exercises on specific math concepts.
*   **Quizlet:** For creating and studying digital flashcards for vocabulary and math formulas.

### Milestone 2: Weeks 5-8 - Deep Dive and Pacing
*   **Goal:** Tackle more complex topics and improve speed and accuracy under time pressure.
*   **Key Activities:** Focus on challenging math problems, scrambled paragraphs, and logical reasoning using problems from the `2022` and `2023` guides. Practice with timed sections.
*   **Outcome:** Increased confidence in all test sections and improved time management skills.

### Milestone 3: Weeks 9-12 - Test-Day Readiness
