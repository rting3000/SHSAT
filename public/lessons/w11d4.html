                    1.  **Categorize Your Errors:** Go through every question you got wrong. Was it a careless mistake, a knowledge gap, or a time management issue?
                    
                    2.  **Create an Error Log:** For each mistake, write down the question, why you got it wrong, and what the correct concept or strategy is. Reviewing this log is one of the most powerful study techniques.
                    
                    3.  **Don't Ignore "Guesses":** Review questions you answered correctly but were unsure about. You might have gotten lucky, and understanding the 'why' will solidify your knowledge.`

                    -   **Know Your Pace:** You have 180 minutes for 114 questions. That's about 1.5 minutes per question. Some will be faster, some slower.
                    
                    -   **Don't Get Stuck:** If a question is too hard, make your best guess, flag it, and move on. You can come back later if you have time. It's better to answer 5 easy questions than to spend 10 minutes on one hard one.
                    
                    -   **Check the Clock:** Check your time at the halfway point of each section to ensure you're on track.`

                    - Read the questions *before* reading the passage to know what to look for.
                    - The answer is always in the text. Don't use outside knowledge. Find direct evidence to support your choice.

                    **Revising & Editing:**
                    - Read the entire paragraph first to get the context.
                    - For grammar questions, focus on the specific rules being tested (fragments, run-ons, subject-verb agreement, etc.).
                    - For "best placement" or "main idea" questions, consider the flow and purpose of the paragraph.`

                    -   **Back-solving:** Plug the answer choices back into the problem. Start with B or C.
                    -   **Estimation:** Eliminate answers that are clearly too big or too small.
                    -   **Draw a Picture:** For geometry problems, a quick sketch can make the solution obvious.

                    **Grid-Ins:**
                    -   There is no penalty for guessing, so never leave a grid-in blank.
                    -   Read the question carefully. Are you solving for the radius or the area? The price or the discount?
                    -   Double-check your bubbling. A simple mistake here can cost you points.`
