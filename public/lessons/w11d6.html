                    Active recovery is as important as active studying. True learning happens when you give your mind a chance to process. Avoid burnout by taking a real break today. Don't do any SHSAT-related work unless it's reviewing your error log.`

                    1.  **Review Your Error Log:** This is the highest-yield activity you can do. Look for patterns. Are you consistently missing geometry questions? Or comma splices?
                    
                    2.  **Drill Your Weaknesses:** Spend 30-60 minutes (no more!) on your #1 weakest area. Don't try to cover everything. Just focus on that single topic.
                    
                    3.  **Plan for Test Day:** Mentally walk through your test day plan. What time will you wake up? What will you eat for breakfast? How will you manage your nerves? Visualizing success can be a powerful tool.`

                    -   **Confidence is Key:** Trust in the work you've done. You have spent weeks preparing. You are ready.
                    -   **Logistics:** Make sure you know where your testing center is, how you'll get there, and what you need to bring (ID, pencils, etc.).
