                    passage: 'The honeybee plays a vital role in agriculture. Beyond producing honey, these insects are responsible for pollinating approximately one-third of the food crops humans consume. Fruits like apples, almonds, and blueberries are almost entirely dependent on bee pollination. Without the honeybee, the cost of these foods would skyrocket, and their availability would plummet. The decline in bee populations is, therefore, a significant threat to global food security.',

Constant notifications from social media, emails, and news apps create a state of perpetual distraction.

Perched on rocky shores, these towers cast powerful beams of light, cutting through fog and darkness to mark dangerous coastlines and safe harbors. While modern GPS and radar have made them less essential for navigation, lighthouses remain powerful cultural symbols of hope and vigilance.',
