                        <p>Today's targets are precision and parts of a whole. For ELA, we're honing <strong>Revising/Editing</strong> skills, focusing on making sentences clear and concise. For Math, we're mastering <strong>Percentages</strong>.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Clarity & Conciseness:</strong> Good writing is direct. Eliminate redundant words and phrases that say the same thing twice (e.g., "twelve noon" is just "noon").</li>
                            <li><strong>Percentages:</strong> A percentage is just a special fraction where the denominator is always 100. To find a percentage of a number, convert the percent to a decimal or fraction and multiply.</li>
