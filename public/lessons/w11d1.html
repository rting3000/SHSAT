(2) Its vast landscape is not just sand dunes; it also includes rocky plateaus, gravel plains, and salt flats. (3) Many people assume the Sahara is devoid of life.

(5) For example, the addax antelope has broad, flat hooves to help it walk on sand and can get most of its water from the plants it eats. (6) Another example is the fennec fox with its large ears that help dissipate heat. (7) These creatures are a testament to the resilience of life in extreme environments.",

The sentences that follow provide specific examples to support this claim."

                    explanation: "When using 'neither...nor', the verb agrees with the subject closer to it. 'Students' is plural, so the plural verb 'were' is correct. In the other sentences, 'Each' and 'flock' are singular subjects that require singular verbs ('is' and 'is', respectively), and 'committee' is a singular collective noun requiring a singular verb ('has')."

                    answer: "Large, uniform, and featureless",
                    explanation: "The context clues 'skyscraper' and 'eyesore' suggest that 'monolithic' has a negative connotation related to size and lack of detail. It implies a massive, imposing structure without interesting features, which contrasts with the 'quaint' historic district."

It is an art of illusion, creating a miniaturized but realistic representation of nature in the form of a tree. Bonsai are not genetically dwarfed plants. In fact, any tree species can be used to grow one. The miniaturization is achieved through techniques such as pruning, root reduction, potting, and grafting.",

                    explanation: "This sentence best captures the main points of the paragraph: that bonsai is a Japanese art form and that it involves specific techniques to achieve its miniature size."

                    answer: "If I were the president, I would lower taxes.",
                    explanation: "The subjunctive mood is used for hypothetical or contrary-to-fact situations. The correct form is 'If I were...', not 'If I was...'. The other sentences incorrectly use the indicative mood ('was') where the subjunctive mood ('were') is required."

Dozens of inventors had been working on 'electric lamps' for decades before Edison. What made Edison's version so successful was his use of a durable, high-resistance carbonized bamboo filament, combined with a better vacuum pump to remove air from the bulb, which prevented the filament from burning out quickly.",
                    question: "According to the passage, what was the key to the success of Edison's light bulb?",
                    options: [
                        "He was the very first person to invent an electric lamp.",

                    answer: "He created a longer-lasting filament and a better vacuum inside the bulb.",

                    answer: "Because the coffee was too cold.",
                    explanation: "A sentence fragment is an incomplete sentence. 'Because the coffee was too cold' is a subordinate clause; it has a subject and a verb but cannot stand on its own as a complete thought. It needs an independent clause to be complete (e.g., 'He didn't drink it because the coffee was too cold.')."

These structures were designed to bring fresh water from distant springs and mountains into the cities and towns. The water flowed entirely by gravity, requiring a precise, steady downward gradient over many miles. Some aqueducts stretched for over 50 miles, a testament to the skill of Roman surveyors and builders.",

                    answer: "The plan is to review our notes, to take a practice test, and celebrating our success.",
                    explanation: "Parallel structure requires that items in a list be in the same grammatical form. The first two items are infinitives ('to review', 'to take'), but the third is a gerund ('celebrating'). It should be 'to celebrate'."

Perhaps most remarkably, it is considered one of the most intelligent invertebrates. Octopuses have been observed using tools, solving complex mazes, and even showing distinct personalities.",

In this context, 'car's' is the possessive form of the noun 'car,' and it is used to show that the tires are a part of the car. The other options are also correct in their use of apostrophes: 'its' is a possessive pronoun, 'they're' is a contraction of 'they are,' and 'who's' is a contraction of 'who is' or 'who has.'",
