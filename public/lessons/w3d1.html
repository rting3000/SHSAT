                        <p>Welcome to Week 3. We are moving into more complex applications of the skills you've learned. In ELA, we continue to hone our ability to find the <strong>Main Idea</strong>, even in dense or subtly written passages. In Math, we are tackling <strong>Advanced Ratios and Proportions</strong>, including multi-step problems.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Main Idea:</strong> Look for the single sentence that best summarizes the entire passage. Ask yourself, "What is the most important point the author wants me to understand?"</li>
                            <li><strong>Advanced Ratios/Proportions:</strong> These problems may involve multiple ratios, changing totals, or require you to set up multi-step proportions to solve. Read carefully.</li>

This problem is flawed. Let\'s fix it. New Q: A bag has a red to blue marble ratio of 3:4. If 10 blue marbles are removed, the ratio becomes 3:2. How many red marbles? Let R=3x, B=4x. 3x / (4x-10) = 3/2. 6x = 12x - 30. 6x = 30. x=5. Red = 3x = 15. This works.'
