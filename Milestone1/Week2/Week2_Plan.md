# Week 2: ELA & Math Fundamentals

This week, you'll focus on core skills in both major sections of the test. The goal is to build a strong foundation.

## Daily Tasks

### **Monday-Wednesday: ELA Focus**
*   **Topic:** Reading Comprehension (Main Idea & Supporting Details).
*   **Task:**
    1.  Read the explanation for Reading Comprehension questions in the `nyc-guide-to-the-shsat-for-2023-admissions-3.pdf` document (in the `Docs` folder).
    2.  Complete 3-4 of the Reading Comprehension passages and question sets from the practice test in that same `2023` guide.
    3.  For every mistake, add it to your `my_mistake_log.md`.

### **Thursday-Saturday: Math Focus**
*   **Topic:** Number Properties & Arithmetic Operations (Fractions, Decimals, Percents).
*   **Task:**
    1.  Review the Math section overview in the `2023` guide.
    2.  Complete the first 25-30 math questions from the practice test in the `2023` guide. These questions are typically weighted towards fundamental concepts.
    3.  If you struggle with any concepts (e.g., dividing fractions), search for that topic on Khan Academy and watch the instructional videos.
    4.  Log every mistake in your `my_mistake_log.md`.

### **Every Day**
*   **Task:** Review your Quizlet vocabulary flashcards for 15 minutes.
*   **Goal:** Consistent, short bursts of practice are more effective for memory than one long session.

### **Sunday: Rest**
*   **Task:** Rest. Don't skip it!
