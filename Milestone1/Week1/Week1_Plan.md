### **Day 1: Know Your Enemy**
*   **Objective:** Understand the structure of the SHSAT.
*   **Mission:** Read the "Test Overview" section in the `2024-2025-nyc-specialized-high-schools-student-handbook.pdf` (in the `Docs` folder).
*   **Reward:** 50 PP

---

### **Day 2: Diagnostic Test - ELA Section**
*   **Objective:** Establish your baseline ELA skills.
*   **Mission:** Complete the **ELA section** of **Practice Test A** from the `nyc-guide-to-the-shsat-for-2024-admissions.pdf`. Do this untimed. The goal is accuracy, not speed.
*   **Reward:** 150 PP

---

### **Day 3: Diagnostic Test - Math Section**
*   **Objective:** Establish your baseline Math skills.
*   **Mission:** Complete the **Math section** of **Practice Test A** from the `nyc-guide-to-the-shsat-for-2024-admissions.pdf`. Again, do not time yourself.
*   **Reward:** 150 PP

### **Day 4: The Mistake Log**
*   **Objective:** Learn from your mistakes. This is the most critical skill.
*   **Mission:**
    1.  Grade your entire diagnostic test using the answer key in the guide.
    2.  Open the `mistake_log_template.md` file in this folder.
    3.  **For every single question you got wrong,** create a new entry in a personal copy of the log. Be detailed!
*   **Reward:** 200 PP (This is the most valuable task of the week!)

### **Day 5: Vocabulary & Scheduling**
*   **Objective:** Build your word arsenal and organize your mission schedule.
*   **Mission Briefing:** A strong vocabulary is a secret weapon in the ELA section.
    *   **Example:** The word `archaic` means "very old or old-fashioned." If you see it in a passage, it tells you something about the time period or the style of the text.
*   **Mission Tasks:**
    1.  Go back through the ELA section you took. Identify 10-15 words you didn't know for sure.
    2.  Create a new study set in Quizlet and add these words.
    3.  Open Google Calendar and schedule your study sessions for the next 4 weeks. A consistent agent is a successful agent.
*   **Reward:** 150 PP

### **Day 6: Intro to Ratios**
*   **Objective:** Understand and solve basic ratio problems.
*   **Mission Briefing:** A ratio is a comparison of two quantities. If a classroom has 12 boys and 18 girls, the ratio of boys to girls is 12 to 18. This can be written as `12:18` or as a fraction `12/18`. Like fractions, ratios can be simplified.
    *   **Example:** Simplify the ratio 12:18.
    *   **Solution:** Find the greatest common divisor of 12 and 18, which is 6. Divide both parts by 6:
        *   12 / 6 = 2
        *   18 / 6 = 3
        *   The simplified ratio is **2:3**.
*   **Practice Problems:**
    1.  A bag contains 8 red marbles and 12 blue marbles. What is the ratio of red marbles to blue marbles in its simplest form?
    2.  A recipe calls for 2 cups of flour and 3 cups of sugar. If you use 6 cups of flour, how much sugar should you use to keep the ratio the same?
    3.  In a school, the ratio of teachers to students is 1:25. If there are 40 teachers, how many students are there?
*   **Reward:** 100 PP

### **Day 7: Rest**
*   **Objective:** Recharge. Every top agent needs downtime. Review your week's accomplishments.
*   **Total Weekly Points:** 800 PP

### **Answer Key for Day 6**
1.  The ratio is 8:12. The greatest common divisor is 4. Simplified ratio is **2:3**.
2.  The ratio is 2 flour : 3 sugar. To get from 2 cups of flour to 6, you multiply by 3. So, multiply the sugar by 3: 3 * 3 = **9 cups of sugar**.
3.  The ratio is 1 teacher : 25 students. To get from 1 teacher to 40, you multiply by 40. So, multiply the students by 40: 25 * 40 = **1000 students**.
