# Week 4: Review & Milestone Check-in

This week is about consolidating what you've learned in the past three weeks and checking your progress with a timed exercise.

## Daily Tasks

### **Monday-Wednesday: Focused Review**
*   **Task:** Review your `my_mistake_log.md`.
*   **Instructions:**
    1.  Go through every single entry you've made so far.
    2.  Do you see any patterns? Are you making the same type of mistake repeatedly?
    3.  For your top 2-3 most common mistakes in both ELA and Math, go back to the `2023` guide or Khan Academy and do extra practice problems on those specific topics.

### **Thursday-Friday: Timed ELA Section**
*   **Topic:** Pacing and Time Management.
*   **Task:** Re-take the **entire ELA section** from **Practice Test A** in the `nyc-guide-to-the-shsat-for-2024-admissions.pdf`.
*   **Instructions:**
    *   This time, you **must** time yourself. Set a timer for **90 minutes** and stop when it goes off, even if you are not finished.
    *   This will feel different. The goal is to see how you perform under time pressure.

### **Saturday: Grade & Analyze**
*   **Task:** Grade your timed ELA section and reflect.
*   **Instructions:**
    1.  Grade the test and log your mistakes.
    2.  Compare your performance to the first time you took this section in Week 1. Did your accuracy improve?
    3.  Think about the timing. Did you run out of time? Did you have too much time left? Write down your reflections.

### **Sunday: Rest & Celebrate**
*   **Task:** Rest. You have officially completed Milestone 1. Take a moment to appreciate the hard work you've put in.
