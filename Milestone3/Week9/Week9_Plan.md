# Week 9: Full Test Simulation

Welcome to Milestone 3, the final push! This milestone is focused on repeated testing, honing your strategy, and building unshakable confidence.

## Daily Tasks

### **Monday-Tuesday: Full Timed Practice Test**
*   **Topic:** Simulating Real Test Conditions.
*   **Task:** Take the `2024+SHSAT+Exam.pdf` found in the `Docs` folder.
*   **Instructions:**
    *   Treat this like the real test day.
    *   180-minute timer. Quiet room. No phone.
    *   Take the test over two days if needed, but a single session is best for building stamina.

### **Wednesday-Saturday: In-Depth Review**
*   **Task:** This is the most important part of the week. Do a deep dive into your results.
*   **Instructions:**
    1.  Grade the test and log every single mistake in `my_mistake_log.md`.
    2.  For each mistake, you must find **5 similar problems** in the older `2022` or `2023` guides and solve them. This drills the concept into your memory.
    3.  On Saturday, review your mistake log from the very beginning of your prep. Look for recurring patterns and make a list of your top 3-5 "demon" problem types.

### **Sunday: Rest**
*   **Task:** Rest. Full practice tests are draining.
