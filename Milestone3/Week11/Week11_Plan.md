# Week 11: Final Full Test & Strategy

This is your last full practice test and your chance to finalize your strategy for the real thing.

## Daily Tasks

### **Monday-Tuesday: Final Timed Practice Test**
*   **Task:** Take **Practice Test B** from the `nyc-guide-to-the-shsat-for-2023-admissions-3.pdf`.
*   **Instructions:**
    *   This is your final dress rehearsal. Treat it with 100% seriousness.
    *   180-minute timer. One sitting.

### **Wednesday-Thursday: Final Review**
*   **Task:** Grade the test and review your mistakes.
*   **Instructions:**
    1.  Log any final mistakes.
    2.  This time, focus less on *what* you got wrong and more on *why*. Did you rush? Did you misread the question? Were you getting tired? Analyze your test-taking behavior.

### **Friday: Final Formula & Grammar Review**
*   **Task:** One last review of the basics.
*   **Instructions:**
    1.  Read through your `Formula Sheet` one more time. Make sure everything is memorized.
    2.  Review the common grammar rules for the Revising/Editing section.

### **Saturday: Create a "Test Day Plan"**
*   **Task:** Write down your official strategy.
*   **Instructions:**
    1.  In a Google Doc, create a "Test Day Plan".
    2.  Include: What time you'll wake up, what you'll eat, what you'll bring (check the `2024-2025 Student Handbook`!), your pacing strategy (e.g., "spend no more than 2 mins per math question"), and your guessing strategy (it's better to guess than leave blank!).
    3.  Having a plan reduces anxiety.

### **Sunday: Rest**
*   **Task:** Rest. You need to be fresh for next week.
