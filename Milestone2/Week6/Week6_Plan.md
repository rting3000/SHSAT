# Week 6: Logical Reasoning & Geometry

This week, you'll work on the logical reasoning ELA questions and dive into the world of shapes and angles in the Math section.

## Daily Tasks

### **Monday-Wednesday: ELA Focus**
*   **Topic:** Logical Reasoning.
*   **Task:**
    1.  This question type can be tricky. Find the Logical Reasoning questions in both the `2022` and `2023` guides.
    2.  Read the questions and answer choices very carefully. Often, the challenge is in understanding exactly what is being asked.
    3.  Work through all the examples available in both guides.
    4.  In your `my_mistake_log.md`, write down the logical trap you fell into for each mistake.

### **Thursday-Saturday: Math Focus**
*   **Topic:** Plane Geometry (Angles, Triangles, Circles, Polygons).
*   **Task:**
    1.  Create a new "Formula Sheet" in Google Docs.
    2.  As you work through geometry problems from the `2022` and `2023` guides, add key formulas and rules to your sheet (e.g., area of a circle, sum of angles in a triangle).
    3.  Use Khan Academy to review any specific shapes you struggle with.
    4.  Log every mistake, noting if it was a formula error or a logic error.

### **Every Day**
*   **Task 1:** Review vocabulary on Quizlet for 15 minutes.
*   **Task 2:** Practice one timed Math section. Use the Math section from the `2022` guide's practice test. Set a timer for 90 minutes.

### **Sunday: Rest**
*   **Task:** Rest.
