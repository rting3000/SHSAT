# Week 5: Revising/Editing & Equations

Welcome to Milestone 2. This phase is about tackling more complex topics and starting to focus on your pacing.

## Daily Tasks

### **Monday-Wednesday: ELA Focus**
*   **Topic:** Revising/Editing (Parts A and B).
*   **Task:**
    1.  The `guide-to-the-specialized-high-schools-admissions-test-for-2022-admissions.pdf` (in the `Docs` folder) has a great ELA practice section.
    2.  Read the explanations for the Revising/Editing section.
    3.  Complete all the Revising/Editing questions from the practice test within that `2022` guide.
    4.  Log every mistake in `my_mistake_log.md`. Pay close attention to the *types* of grammar rules you are missing.

### **Thursday-Saturday: Math Focus**
*   **Topic:** Solving Linear Equations and Inequalities.
*   **Task:**
    1.  Work through the math practice questions in the `2022` guide, identifying all problems that involve solving for a variable (e.g., `3x + 5 = 14`).
    2.  Use Khan Academy to get extra practice on "two-step equations" and "linear inequalities."
    3.  Log every mistake.

### **Every Day**
*   **Task 1:** Review your Quizlet vocabulary flashcards for 15 minutes.
*   **Task 2 (New):** Practice one timed ELA passage or 5 timed math problems from any of the guides. The goal is to get used to the clock.

### **Sunday: Rest**
*   **Task:** Rest. This milestone is more challenging, so rest is critical.
