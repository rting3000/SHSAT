# Week 7: Advanced ELA & Math Topics

Let's tackle some of the more challenging and less frequent topics on the test. Mastering these can give you a real edge.

## Daily Tasks

### **Monday-Wednesday: ELA Focus**
*   **Topic:** Poetry & Literary Devices.
*   **Task:**
    1.  Go through the reading passages in the `2022` and `2023` guides and specifically find any poems or passages with strong figurative language.
    2.  Make sure you know the definitions of basic literary devices (e.g., simile, metaphor, personification, imagery).
    3.  Practice identifying these devices and, more importantly, understanding *why* the author uses them.
    4.  Log any mistakes in your `my_mistake_log.md`.

### **Thursday-Saturday: Math Focus**
*   **Topic:** 3D Geometry (Volume, Surface Area) & Coordinate Geometry.
*   **Task:**
    1.  Add formulas for volume and surface area of common 3D shapes (cubes, rectangular prisms, cylinders) to your formula sheet.
    2.  Review the coordinate plane, including finding slope and distance between two points.
    3.  Find the most challenging geometry problems from the `2022` and `2023` guides to use for practice.
    4.  Log every mistake.

### **Every Day**
*   **Task 1:** Vocab review on Quizlet (15 mins).
*   **Task 2:** Mix and match timed sections. Do a timed ELA section one day and a timed Math section the next. Use any of the guides for material.

### **Sunday: Rest**
*   **Task:** Rest.
